For example, if Mairsil exiles Izzet Chemister, cards exiled with the first ability Mairsil gained from Izzet Chemister can be cast if you activate the second ability it gained that way. Izzet Chemister itself can’t be cast this way, and if Mairsil leaves the battlefield before activating that second ability, the cards exiled with that first ability are lost forever."},{"object":"ruling","oracle_id":"ed5fbae0-2dca-44a5-84dc-62674b3a92a6","source":"wotc","published_at":"2017-08-25","comment":"If Mairsil has a crew ability, creatures can crew Mairsil.
